## This is comment for .cstyle file, .cstyle files are used by diorite configs to define how configuration should look like in .yml file.
## Diorite will automatically try to find .cstyle file for configuration file - but it can be also selected manually
## It can be used both to generate comments and to set spacing, serialization styles etc.
## empty comments like this:
##
## are used to create fake-spacing to make .cstyle file more readable
## when adding comments/styles to maps/list you can use `*` key to just ignore given level.
##
## .cstyle files are compatible with .comments files - as .comments parser will just ignore any special data and only read comments from it

# global style defaults
@{
  alwaysUseQuotation, ## use quotes even for simple values like `a`
}

# This is header of configuration file
# multi-line support

# this comment will appear above value
value:
## as there is no empty line between value and second value - there will be no empty line in final .yaml too
# this is second value comment
secondValue

## comments can be localized - special files/handler must be provided to configuration manager to find valid values for each language/locale
#$my.comment.path
# default for missing locale (can be also provided via file/handler)
withLocalizedComment:
##
alwaysMultiLine: multiline{spaces=2, noNewLine} ## these are default values so just "multiline" would be enough

folded: folded{keepNewLines, maxLineLength=50}
##
mapOfObjects: {spacing=1}
  *:
    beanValueInt: 0x00 ## hex!
    beanValueStringList: inline ## always use simple [a,b,c] syntax, even for long values
  # Extra comment for this key!
  keyB: ## if no style is provided here it will use style from wildcard element
    beanValueStringList: unfolded
  keyC:
    # another extra comment
    beanValueInt:
inlineBean: inline
